This is a report for my project in my course "Data Visualization Tools" in my third year at my university and I got a 20/20 grade thankfully. I used processing 4 sketch with it's own language that's a bit similar to java. In that report i explained how to do it from scratch with amazing brainstorming systematically.


However, here i had a list of egypt governorates with it's population and more related stuff about these governorates. So here comes the art of generating my own questions as explained in the report.
